# Home Automation through IOT using cloud servies
## Project Overview
### Description:
The Remote Light Bulb Automation System is a project designed to enable the remote control of light bulbs using a Microcontroller (Arduino UNO) and a web-based application hosted on Google App Engine. The system aims to provide a cost-effective, reliable, and scalable solution for automating tasks that involve physical or monotonous work.

## Key Features:
Remote Control: Users can switch on or off a light bulb remotely from a web-based interface.
Global Accessibility: The system targets users from over 215 countries, making it accessible worldwide.
Voice Control: Integration with Cloud Speech Recognition allows users to control devices using voice commands.
Google App Engine Website: A web application hosted on Google App Engine serves as the central hub for device control, featuring a dashboard for real-time status updates and settings adjustment.

## Implementation:
### Microcontroller (Arduino UNO):
Acts as the interface between the light bulb and the Google App Engine website.

### Google App Engine Website:
Hosts the web application providing the user interface for controlling devices.
Facilitates real-time communication with the Microcontroller.

### Cloud Speech Recognition:
Enables voice commands for controlling the light bulb remotely.
